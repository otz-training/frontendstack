## GET and POST method in FROM :

- Client will send reuest to the server using HTTP Protocol.

- When client sends httpReuest the data from client to server
  can be sent using two method.

  a. get method
  b. post method

- GET Method is default method.

- When client submits the form data using GET Method then all the data will sent to the server by attaching with the http header.

- So , we can send limited amount of data upto 4KB

- If client sends data using get method ,it is shown to all public ,which is not secure.

- Sending httpreuest using get method is faster.

- If client will send data more than 4kb then sending reuest using get method will not work ,thats why we need Post method

- Uisng post method if client sends reuest then all data will go to the server by attaching with http body.

- Using Post method we send data upto 2GB.

- If we send data using post method then it is secure.

- Send reuest using post method will be little slower than get method.

- There are some other methods we can use to send data from client to server.

  POST
  PUT
  DELETE
